# CBOMkit Project Lifecycle status

The Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance [Project Lifecycle Policy](https://pqca.github.io/TAC/Processes/Project_Lifecycle.html) describes the stages for technical projects within the PQCA.

The CBOMkit Technical Steering Committee presently classifies the CBOMkit as an Incubation-stage project within the Production Projects track. 

We recognize that some organizations are using CBOMkit, and additional stakeholders may be interested in seeing the project advance. We would welcome increased involvement to grow the contributor and maintainer base.
